pip install mpesa-c2b-sdk
```

## Quick start
```python
from mpesa_c2b_sdk.payments import register_url, simulate

register_url(
    short_code="600584",
    response_type="Completed",
    confirmation_url="[https://yourdomain.com/confirmation](https://yourdomain.com/confirmation)",
    validation_url="[https://yourdomain.com/validation](https://yourdomain.com/validation)"
)

simulate(
    short_code="600584",

    amount=100,
    phone_number="2547XXXXXXXX",
